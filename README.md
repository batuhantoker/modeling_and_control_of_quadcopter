# modeling_and_control_of_drone
 MATLAB implementation of modeling and control of drone

You can use simulink file to modulate simulation characteristics (motion planing, control parameter adjustment)
Then, the simulation .m file helps you to visualize the outputs of your model and saves it as .mp4 file.
More explanation on the methodology used can be found in report.pdf.
